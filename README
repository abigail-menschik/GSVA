Installing GSVA
===============

In order to successfully install and run GSVA you need to
install first the GNU Scientific Library (GSL) which you
can find in the following URL:

http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl

Once you have installed the GSL, if you have done it
"system-wide" then you can install GSVA in the usual
way as with any other Bioconductor package:

biocLite("GSVA")

However, if you have installed the GSL in a non system-wide
location of you hard disk, you should provide this location
to biocLite() as follows:

biocLite("GSVA", configure.args="--with-gsl-lib=\"/where/gsl/lib/is\" --with-gsl-include=\"/where/gsl/include/is\"")

If, alternatively, you have downloaded yourself the source
tarball of GSVA and want to install it from the shell, then
you should use:

R CMD INSTALL --configure-args="--with-gsl-lib=`R RHOME`/lib --with-gsl-include=`R RHOME`/include" GSVA_X.Y.Z.tar.gz

where X.Y.Z is the corresponding version of GSVA that you have
actually downloaded.
