Unix/Mac users
==============

In order to successfully install and run GSVA in Unix/Mac
systems you need to install first the GNU Scientific Library
(GSL) which you can find in the following URL:

http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl

Follow the link to the FTP site and download the lastest tar ball or,
in any case, one with version >= 1.12, for instance, to your
'Desktop' directory. Then go to the shell and type the following
instruccions for a system-wide installation (assuming the tar ball
has name 'gsl-1.15.tar.gz':

$ cd Desktop
$ gzip -cd gsl-1.15.tar.gz | tar xvf -
$ cd gsl-1.15
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

The latter instruction will ask you for the system administration
password which may very well be the your own user password. If you
do not have system administration privileges, you can either ask your
sysadmin to make this system-wide installation of GSL or install GSL
yourself on another location of the filesystem where you have writing
permissions. This can be done by replacing the call to 'configure' by:

$ ./configure --prefix=/home/myusername/gsl

Then make sure that your PATH environment variable
allows you to execute the script 'gsl-config' located in the 'bin'
subdirectory of the GSL installation. This can be verified by writting 
n the shell:

$ which gsl-config

without obtaining an error. If you get an error, locate the path where
the 'gsl-config' script is and add it to the PATH environment variable.
Alternatively, you can set the environment variable GSL_CONFIG to this
path, thus avoiding to modify the PATH environment variable.

After this, you can install GSVA in the usual way as with any other
Bioconductor package by writting the following instructions in the
R shell:

source("http://www.bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("GSVA")

Windows users
=============

In order to successfully install and run GSVA in a Windows
system you need to install first the GNU Scientific Library
(GSL) which, in the case of windows, you should download from
the following URL:

http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gsl.htm

It is recommended that you download the file under the 'Setup'
link described as "Complete package, except sources'. You should
execute the downloaded file and perform the installation either
system-wide, for which you'll need system administration privileges,
or in some path where you have writting permissions.

By default, this package installs GSL at 'C:\Program Files\GnuWin32'
and assume this is the case now. Go to the folder

C:\Program Files\GnuWin32\bin

and copy the file 'libgsl.dll' into 'libgsl-0.dll'. Then add the path
where these files are located to your PATH environment variable by
right-clicking on the "My PC" icon, select "Properties", go to the
"Advanced" tab, clic on "Environment variables", select "Path" on the
"Environment variables" box, click on "Modify", and add to the end of
the current string:

;C:/PROGRA~1/GNUWIN32/bin

then press 'Ok' through out all previously opened dialog boxes and
you should be able to install GSVA in the usual way as with any other
Bioconductor package by writting the following instructions in the
R shell:

source("http://www.bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("GSVA")
